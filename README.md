I am a lifelong learner. My name is Dakshitha and I am a Co-Founder @ Zfrozen based in Sri Lanka. 
I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to everything fun and make hard concepts easy to understand.

Things that I do  
• Programming in ReactJs.  
• UI/UX, both Web Applications and Mobile Applications cross-platform Native.  
• Develop Web Applications with ReactJs and NodeJs.  

Thank you for stopping by! ❤️
